Project Title: PDFMagic - Feature-Rich Online PDF Processing Suite
Objective:Develop a comprehensive, user-friendly web application that provides essential PDF manipulation tools with a clean, modern interface. The application should allow users to perform various PDF operations without requiring software installation or technical expertise.
Technical Requirements:
Frontend Framework:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla or optionally Vue.js/React for enhanced interactivity)
Responsive design with mobile-first approach
Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Core Features:
PDF Merging: Combine multiple PDFs into a single document
PDF Splitting: Extract specific pages or split by page ranges
PDF Compression: Reduce file size with quality preservation
Format Conversion: Convert to/from Word, Excel, JPG, PNG
PDF Editing: Add text, images, annotations, watermarks
Security Features: Password protection and permission management
User Interface Components:
Clean, intuitive dashboard with tool selection grid
Drag-and-drop file upload areas with visual feedback
Progress indicators for file processing
Download buttons for processed files
Error handling with user-friendly messages
Detailed Feature Specifications:
1. File Handling System:
Implement robust file upload handling with:
Drag-and-drop functionality (HTML5 File API)
File type validation (accept only PDFs where required)
Size limits (e.g., 50MB per file) with proper error messaging
Preview of selected files before processing
Queue management for multiple file operations
2. PDF Merging Tool:
Allow selection of multiple PDFs
Provide drag-to-reorder functionality for merged sequence
Options for:
Normal merging (all pages)
Selective page merging (choose specific pages from each document)
Merge with separator pages between documents
3. PDF Splitting Tool:
Multiple split methods:
Split by page ranges (e.g., 1-3, 5-7)
Extract every single page as separate file
Split by maximum file size
Split after every X pages
Visual page thumbnail preview for selection
4. PDF Compression:
Three compression levels with estimated output size preview:
Low (minimum compression, fastest)
Medium (balanced)
High (maximum compression, slower)
Option to remove embedded images/fonts
Quality slider for image compression
5. Conversion Tools:
PDF to:
Word (preserve formatting)
Excel (table extraction)
JPG/PNG (per page or combined)
PowerPoint (for presentations)
From other formats to PDF with formatting preservation
6. Editing Features:
Basic text editing (add/modify text)
Image insertion with resize/position controls
Page manipulation:
Rotate
Delete
Reorder
Insert blank pages
Annotation tools (highlight, underline, comments)
Watermark addition with customization options
7. Security Features:
Password protection with strength indicator
Permission controls:
Printing restrictions
Copying prevention
Editing restrictions
Option to remove existing security
Technical Implementation Details:
Frontend Architecture:
Modular component structure for easy maintenance
State management for file processing workflow
Lazy loading for improved performance
Web Workers for heavy processing tasks
Backend Considerations (for future implementation):
Node.js/Express or Python backend for file processing
PDF processing libraries (PDF-lib, pdf.js, Ghostscript)
Cloud storage for temporary file handling
Queue system for handling multiple concurrent requests
UI/UX Requirements:
Visual Design:
Color scheme: Professional blues and whites with accent colors
Consistent spacing and typography hierarchy
Micro-interactions for user actions (hovers, clicks)
User Flow:
Tool selection → File upload → Options configuration → Processing → Download
Clear progress indicators at each stage
Undo/redo capabilities where applicable
Accessibility:
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
Keyboard navigation support
ARIA labels for screen readers
Performance Optimization:
Client-side processing where possible
Chunked file uploading for large files
Memory management for large PDFs
Loading states during processing
Error Handling:
Invalid file type detection
Corrupted PDF handling
Size limit enforcement
Network interruption recovery
Additional Features for Future Expansion:
OCR functionality for scanned documents
PDF form creation and filling
Digital signature support
Batch processing capabilities
Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
User accounts for saving processing history
Testing Requirements:
Cross-browser testing
Mobile device testing
Performance testing with various file sizes
Security testing for file handling
Deliverables:
Fully functional frontend interface
Clean, well-commented code
Responsive design implementation
Documentation for future development
Success Metrics:
Processing time under 30 seconds for average documents
95%+ successful operation rate
Intuitive UX requiring minimal instructions
Timeline:
Phase 1: Core functionality (2 weeks)
Phase 2: Advanced features (1 week)
Phase 3: Testing and refinement (1 week)
Budget:[To be determined based on development resources]
